                <p>CarRentals.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.</p>
                <p>You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy ("Claims") by contacting Customer Support at support@CarRentals.com. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.</p>
                <p> <strong>Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court</strong> , except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration. </p>
                <p> <strong> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneysâ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would. </strong> </p>
                <p>Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitratorâs fees, unless the arbitrator determines your Claims are frivolous. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
                <p> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to "CarRentals Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager," c/o Expedia, Inc., 333 108<sup>th</sup> Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA, at Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 or online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or at any AAA office. </p>
                <p> <strong> Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. </strong> If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction. </p>

                <p>Some banks and credit cards impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since CarRentals.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
