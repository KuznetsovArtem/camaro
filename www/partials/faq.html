                            <p>Yes. At check-in, the driver will need to present a valid driver's license and credit card -- both must match the driver's name.</p><p>If the driver's license is in a language other than English or the language of the country in which you are renting, an International Driver's Permit is recommended. In all cases, a valid driver's license issued in your home country must be provided (whether or not you possess an International Driver's Permit). You will not be allowed to rent a car with only an International Driver's Permit.</p><p>For rental deposits in the U.S. and Canada, you should have at least $200 in available funds. If you are using a debit card, the car rental company will place a hold on your deposit amount, and you will not have access to these funds until the car is returned. For rentals outside of the U.S. and Canada, you may need as much as $1000 in available funds, and you will be required to use a credit card for deposit. Debit cards will not be accepted for deposit on international rentals.</p><p>If optional items are elected for purchase (e.g., insurance), additional available credit will be required. Please note that the amount of available credit that is necessary varies, depending on the type of car and the rental period.</p><p>Note that many car rental companies will not accept a debit card as a deposit when the vehicle is picked up, and you will be denied rental. Be aware that car rental companies will not accept a prepaid or 'stored value' card, including those showing a MasterCard or Visa logo.</p>

If you do not have a reservation, you must provide us with ALL the details (car vendor, car type, pick up location, if over 25 years old, and whether you are a local renter or not) and we can help. After you make a reservation, you will be given the toll-free number for the vendor and if you prefer, you can contact the car vendor yourself directly.

                            <p>Sure. You can request child seats, GPS, ski racks, CD players, etc. by emailing us or calling the vendor directly. Not all vendors or locations will have the requested items so please check before you arrive at the counter. Additional drivers can only be added at the time of pickup. They must be present at that time. Fees for additional drivers vary by location and vendor.</p>
