One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a car in New York on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special travel deal in New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York car deals by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York car rentals in the email, you may receive an email about New York car rental offers. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.</p>

                <p>Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our website.

This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

                <p>We also may share your information:</p>

                    <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information. We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>
